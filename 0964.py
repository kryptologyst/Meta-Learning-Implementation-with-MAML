Project 964: Meta-learning Implementation
Description
Meta-learning, or "learning to learn," enables models to adapt to new tasks with minimal data. It focuses on training models to generalize across tasks. In this project, we’ll implement a meta-learning system using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), which allows a model to learn quickly from a small number of examples.

Python Implementation with Comments (Meta-Learning using MAML)
We'll use the learn2learn library, which provides a simple implementation of MAML. This will allow us to apply meta-learning to tasks like few-shot classification.

        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = torch.max_pool2d(x, 2)

        x = torch.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))

Key Concepts Covered:
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML): A meta-learning algorithm that trains models to quickly adapt to new tasks.

Few-shot learning: Training a model to perform well with only a few examples from a new task.

Meta-training Loop: The process of training the model on multiple tasks, optimizing it for fast adaptation.
